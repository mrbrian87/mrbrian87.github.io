            <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>My name is Brian. I was born in Etobicoke and lived in Bolton until I was 4 years old. My family then moved to Burlington and I have lived there ever since.<br><br> 
                    I am married to a wonderful woman named Melissa, and together we have 3 children. Our oldest is 4 and is named Theo, and we have twin 2 year olds: Samantha, and Joshua.</p>

        <div id="work" class="section" style="display:none">
            <h2>Work History</h2>
                <p>My first job I ever had was as a "rink rat" or maintenance at Skyway arena in Burlington. My duties were mostly just to keep everything clean, but I also did get the opportunity to drive the Zamboni to clear the ice.<br><br> 
                    After I left there I worked doing data entry for a medical billing company. I worked there until an opportunity came along to join a travelling carnival.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hobbies" class="section" style="display:none">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>My main hobby is that I play bass guitar. I started playing when I was 14 and have always considered it to be a core part of who I am. In my youth I played in some bands that wrote original music, but mostly now I play in cover bands with friends. We mainly cover rock and alt-rock music from the 90s and early 2000s. I also have an interest in video games, trivia, and learning new things. 
                For example, I am having a blast learning different Javascript and CSS tricks while building this page!</p>
